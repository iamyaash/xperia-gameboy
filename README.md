# Sony-Boy
Turn your **`Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact`** into a pocket-sized retro gaming handheld.

This project documents how to repurpose the **Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact** into a Game Boy-style emulator device. It's designed specifically with this phone in mind, its **compact size, powerful processor, and stereo speakers** (_it doesn't have headphone jack tho_) make it ideal for retro gaming.

> ⚠️ While the general steps can be adapted to other Android phones, optimizations here are **specific to the XZ2 Compact**. Use caution and adjust manually for other devices.
